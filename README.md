Designing Software:
Approach to Designing Software:
I focus on breaking down the requirements into manageable components, ensuring alignment with user needs and project goals. I use a structured process that includes brainstorming, wireframing, and iterative prototyping.

New Design Skills Crafted:
This project has enhanced my ability to conceptualize layouts and implement physics-based interactivity. I’ve gained skills in creating dynamic elements that respond to user input and environmental changes.

Design Process Followed:
I followed an iterative design process, starting with a basic structure and progressively refining it. Feedback loops ensured continuous improvement.

Future Application of Design Tactics:
My experience with modularity, user engagement principles, and visual appeal will inform future software, ensuring designs are efficient and user-centric.

Developing Programs:
Approach to Developing Programs:
I approach programming by prioritizing modularity and incremental development. Breaking the program into smaller tasks ensures functionality and easier debugging.

New Development Strategies Used:
For my 3D scene, I implemented collision handling and state changes dynamically, leveraging reusable classes to simplify complex interactions.

Role of Iteration:
Iteration was central to the project, enabling refinement of features like animation, brick layouts, and user controls. Each cycle added robustness to the system.

Evolved Coding Approach:
Over the milestones, I’ve transitioned to more structured, well-documented code, incorporating industry best practices to ensure maintainability.

Broader Impacts of Computer Science:
Reaching My Goals:
Computer science equips me with problem-solving techniques and tools to bring creative solutions to life, aligning with my career aspirations.

Impact of Computational Graphics and Visualizations:
Educationally, they deepen my understanding of math and physics applications, while professionally, they enable the creation of engaging, interactive systems essential in fields like game design and simulation.
